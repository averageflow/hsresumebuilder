                    I am a Software Engineer with DevOps experience that is always eager to learn while perfecting my skills and projects and taking on challenges. Living in The Netherlands since 2019, born 23/12/1996 in Spain.
I love to make software solutions, improving and automating workflows, creating fast and reliable programs, helping others understand computers better and to express myself via my creations. 
I love the Ops side of the projects and platforms too. I am a UNIX guy and can work comfortably with Linux, BSDs and macOS, in that order of preference. I like distributed tracing and understand observability might be critical for corporations.
