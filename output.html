                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    I am a Software Engineer with DevOps experience that is always eager to learn while perfecting my skills and projects and taking on challenges. Living in The Netherlands since 2019, born 23/12/1996 in Spain.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    I love to create solutions, improving, automating workflows, creating fast and reliable programs, helping and teaching others and to express myself via my creations.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    I love the Ops side of the projects and platforms too. I am a UNIX guy and can work comfortably with Linux, BSDs and macOS, in that order of preference. I like distributed tracing, infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD, and type-safe languages.

                <p>
                    I love playing guitar and creating some loops in Logic Pro. I have a secret passion for building computers and recycling them, as well as modding operating systems and tinkering with bootloaders, making my own servers and playing with FreeBSD and other Linux distributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to blog about my tech opinions and like to play strategy games sometimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love natural wood and stone and you might find me sanding furniture down, oiling wood, or removing weeds from the garden.
